**What is Ansible?**

Ansible is an open-source IT automation engine used to streamline various IT tasks, including provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. As a free tool, Ansible leverages the collective knowledge and contributions of a vast community of users and developers.

**How Ansible Works**

Ansible operates without the need for agent software on managed nodes, making it agentless. To automate tasks on Linux and Windows systems, Ansible connects to these managed nodes and deploys small programs known as Ansible modules. These modules, which model the desired state of the system, are executed over SSH (Secure Shell) by default. After execution, Ansible removes these modules. The design of these modules emphasizes idempotency, ensuring that changes are made only when necessary to achieve the desired state.

For network devices and other IT appliances that do not support module execution, Ansible operates directly from the control node. Even in such cases, its agentless nature allows it to manage these devices without needing additional software installations on the managed nodes.
